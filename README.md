Test Automation Engineer | Selenium | Cypress | Cucumber | Appium | WebDriverIO | JMeter | Grafana | Selenium Grid | Postman | Rest Assured | Manual Testing

Summary
I am an experienced SQA Engineer with over 5 years of expertise in both manual and automated testing. My career has been marked by my ability to design, develop, and implement comprehensive testing strategies that ensure the highest quality of software products. Below are the key areas of my experience and achievements:

UI Automation
I have a strong background in UI automation, having worked on multiple projects using Selenium with Java, C#, and Python. My proficiency in these tools has enabled me to create robust and efficient test scripts that significantly reduce manual testing efforts and enhance the reliability of the test results.

Current Focus
Currently, I am leveraging Cypress Cucumber for UI automation and manual testing. Cypress, with its powerful capabilities, combined with Cucumber for behavior-driven development, allows me to write and execute high-quality, readable tests.

Mobile Automation
In addition to web automation, I have substantial experience in mobile automation using Appium with WebDriverIO and JavaScript. My skills in mobile testing have been crucial in ensuring that mobile applications perform seamlessly across various devices and platforms.

API Testing
I have successfully conducted API testing using Rest Assured and Postman. These tools have been instrumental in verifying the reliability and performance of backend services, ensuring that they meet the required specifications and performance standards.

Performance Testing and Monitoring
Performance testing is another area where I excel. I have used JMeter for performance and load testing to simulate real-world scenarios and identify potential bottlenecks in the system. Furthermore, I have experience in server-side monitoring, using Grafana to visualize and analyze performance metrics, which helps in proactive performance management and optimization.

Key Achievement
One of my significant achievements is the development of a versatile test automation framework with Selenium and Java. This framework has been designed to be adaptable and efficient, allowing for its use in both QA and production environments. It has greatly enhanced the efficiency of our testing processes and contributed to higher quality releases.

Continuous Learning and Passion
My passion for the QA field drives me to continuously learn and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in software testing. I am always eager to take on new challenges and grow further in this exciting and dynamic domain.
